# Google Cloud Platform

As Google Cloud Platform offers enough resources in its free tier, that's the option we will use for **staging server** and **docker container registry**. 

If you haven't one already, go to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and sign up for an account. And then [create a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) under that account.

## Docker container registry

* [Docker registry setup](docker-registry.md#Setup)
* [Push to registry](docker-registry-push.md)
* [Pull from registry](docker-registry-pull.md)

## Compute Engine

* [Compute Engine setup](compute-engine-setup.md)
