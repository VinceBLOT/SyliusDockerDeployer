# Whether to use *-WWW profile (if your server name is in www subdomain) or 
# *-NON-WWW (if it is one subdomain other than www or localhost). Usually
# *-WWW profile is used in your production site and *-NON-WWW in your 
# staging one and localhost.
#
# To automate the certificate request, we need to define what profile to use at
# every step of the process. NON-SECURE-* before request and SECURE-* after.
#
# In local development stages you usually choose the NON-SECURE-NON-WWW option.
# In production, if your host is under a subdomain other than www, you should
# choose the *-NON-WWW option.
#
# Before issuing the certificate request, PROXY_PROFILE_NON_SECURE will be used
# in PROXY_PROFILE, and after issuing it successfully, it will change to 
# PROXY_PROFILE_SECURE.
#
# Note that non www hostnames like "http://domain.com" are not supported in
# production.

# Values: NON-SECURE-WWW|NON-SECURE-NON-WWW|SECURE-WWW|SECURE-NON-WWW
