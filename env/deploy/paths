# Our Stack path will be replicated inside app container and also in remote
# host (outside docker containers). 

# In almost any remote platform you will have limited write permissions, so you
# will need to host your stack under your ${LOCAL_USER} folder in dev envs and
# under ${REMOTE_USER} folder in prod envs.
